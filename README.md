Children in orphanages do not always have the resources to get a good education. EduCare
is a secure platform that enables people to collectively raise funds to academically sponsor
orphan children. Our platform partners with orphanages and allows donors to fund money for
school fees, to buy things like notebooks, stationary, uniforms, etc. It also provides donors to
keep track of the childrensâ€™ progress.
